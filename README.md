## üéØ What This Means for You

Imagine having a sales expert that instantly knows everything about your deals and can give you winning strategies. That's what this AI does with your Salesforce data.

### üí¨ Just Chat Naturally - No Technical Skills Needed

**You say:** *"Show me all Microsoft deals over $100K in the proposal stage"*  
**AI does:** Searches your entire Salesforce database and returns matching opportunities

**You say:** *"How's the engagement on the Acme deal? Are we talking to the right people?"*  
**AI does:** Analyzes all your calls, emails, and activities to give engagement insights

**You say:** *"Find me deals similar to this opportunity that we won"*  
**AI does:** Scans your database for similar successful deals and success patterns

**You say:** *"Create a business case document for this opportunity"*  
**AI does:** Generates a professional PDF ready for executives

### üöÄ Real Conversation Examples

**Scenario:** *"I'm struggling with the Acme Corp deal. It's been stuck in negotiation for 2 months."*

**AI Response:** *"Let me analyze the Acme opportunity... I see limited engagement in the past 3 weeks. You've had 2 calls with procurement but haven't connected with the decision maker yet. Similar deals that got unstuck had executive sponsor engagement. I found 3 comparable deals where scheduling an executive briefing moved things forward. Here's a business case document you can use..."*

---

**Scenario:** *"My manager wants to know why our cloud migration deals are taking so long to close."*

**AI Response:** *"Analyzing your cloud migration opportunities... The average sales cycle is 40% longer than industry standard. The pattern shows deals stall in the technical evaluation stage. Successful cloud deals had solution architects engaged 2 weeks earlier on average. I recommend involving technical resources sooner..."*

Add the following configuration to the `mcpServers` object in your config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce-cloud": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/salesforce-cloud/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SF_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "SF_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
        "SF_USERNAME": "your_salesforce_username",
        "SF_PASSWORD": "your_salesforce_password",
        "SF_LOGIN_URL": "https://login.salesforce.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Required Environment Variables

- `SF_CLIENT_ID`: Your Salesforce OAuth client ID
- `SF_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Salesforce OAuth client secret
- `SF_USERNAME`: Your Salesforce username
- `SF_PASSWORD`: Your Salesforce password
- `SF_LOGIN_URL`: Salesforce login URL (optional, defaults to https://login.salesforce.com)

To obtain these credentials:

1. Go to Setup in your Salesforce org
2. Navigate to App Manager
3. Create a new Connected App
4. Enable OAuth settings
5. Add necessary OAuth scopes
6. Save and wait for activation
7. Copy the generated Consumer Key (Client ID) and Consumer Secret (Client Secret)

## üéØ Working with Custom Fields

When constructing queries or working with Salesforce data, it's important to understand that many fields referenced may be custom fields specific to your Salesforce instance. Here's what you need to know:

### Understanding Custom Fields
- Custom fields in Salesforce end with `__c` in their API names
- What appears as "Implementation Status" in the UI might be stored as "Implementation_Status__c"
- Custom fields can represent organization-specific business concepts

### Best Practices
1. Object Metadata Analysis:
   - Use the `describe_object` tool with `includeFields: true` to examine both standard and custom fields
   - Look for fields that match your intent in both standard and custom field lists
   - Map user-friendly field names to their actual API names

2. Field Type Consideration:
   - Custom fields can be various types (text, picklist, lookup, etc.)
   - Understanding field types helps construct appropriate queries
   - Custom fields might reference other custom objects through lookup relationships

3. Query Construction:
   - Build queries that can handle both standard and custom fields
   - Use field metadata to validate field existence before querying
   - Consider relationships between objects, especially with custom lookup fields

### Example
If searching for "Project Status":
1. First, examine the object's fields to find the actual field name:
```javascript
{
  "objectName": "Opportunity",
  "includeFields": true
}
```
2. Look for fields like "Project_Status__c" or similar custom fields that match your intent
3. Use the discovered field name in your queries:
```javascript
{
  "query": "SELECT Id, Name, Project_Status__c FROM Opportunity"
}
```
