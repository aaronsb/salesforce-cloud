# üå©Ô∏è Salesforce MCP Server

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides tools for interacting with Salesforce, with built-in pagination and simplified data structures to manage response sizes.

## ü§î What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and resources. MCP servers provide specific capabilities that can be used by AI models through a consistent interface. This Salesforce MCP server allows AI models to interact with Salesforce data and operations in a structured way.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The server requires configuration in your Claude desktop app's configuration file. On Linux, this is located at `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. On macOS, it's at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

Add the following configuration to the `mcpServers` object in your config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce-cloud": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/salesforce-cloud/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SF_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "SF_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
        "SF_USERNAME": "your_salesforce_username",
        "SF_PASSWORD": "your_salesforce_password",
        "SF_LOGIN_URL": "https://login.salesforce.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Required Environment Variables

- `SF_CLIENT_ID`: Your Salesforce OAuth client ID
- `SF_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Salesforce OAuth client secret
- `SF_USERNAME`: Your Salesforce username
- `SF_PASSWORD`: Your Salesforce password
- `SF_LOGIN_URL`: Salesforce login URL (optional, defaults to https://login.salesforce.com)

To obtain these credentials:

1. Go to Setup in your Salesforce org
2. Navigate to App Manager
3. Create a new Connected App
4. Enable OAuth settings
5. Add necessary OAuth scopes
6. Save and wait for activation
7. Copy the generated Consumer Key (Client ID) and Consumer Secret (Client Secret)

## üéØ Working with Custom Fields

When constructing queries or working with Salesforce data, it's important to understand that many fields referenced may be custom fields specific to your Salesforce instance. Here's what you need to know:

### Understanding Custom Fields
- Custom fields in Salesforce end with `__c` in their API names
- What appears as "Implementation Status" in the UI might be stored as "Implementation_Status__c"
- Custom fields can represent organization-specific business concepts

### Best Practices
1. Object Metadata Analysis:
   - Use the `describe_object` tool with `includeFields: true` to examine both standard and custom fields
   - Look for fields that match your intent in both standard and custom field lists
   - Map user-friendly field names to their actual API names

2. Field Type Consideration:
   - Custom fields can be various types (text, picklist, lookup, etc.)
   - Understanding field types helps construct appropriate queries
   - Custom fields might reference other custom objects through lookup relationships

3. Query Construction:
   - Build queries that can handle both standard and custom fields
   - Use field metadata to validate field existence before querying
   - Consider relationships between objects, especially with custom lookup fields

### Example
If searching for "Project Status":
1. First, examine the object's fields to find the actual field name:
```javascript
{
  "objectName": "Opportunity",
  "includeFields": true
}
```
2. Look for fields like "Project_Status__c" or similar custom fields that match your intent
3. Use the discovered field name in your queries:
```javascript
{
  "query": "SELECT Id, Name, Project_Status__c FROM Opportunity"
}
```

  "pageNumber": 1
}
```

The tool returns opportunities that match ALL specified criteria (AND logic). Results are ordered by close date and include key opportunity details such as name, account, amount, and stage.

### get_opportunity_details

  "pageSize": 10,
  "pageNumber": 1
}
```

## üì¶ Response Formats

### Paginated Response
Operations that return multiple records use this format:
```typescript
{
  records: T[];           // Array of records for the current page
  totalSize: number;      // Total number of records
  pageInfo: {
    currentPage: number;  // Current page number
    totalPages: number;   // Total number of pages
    hasNextPage: boolean; // Whether there are more pages after this one
    hasPreviousPage: boolean; // Whether there are pages before this one
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

All tools return errors in a consistent format:
```typescript
{
  content: [{
    type: "text",
    text: "Error: [error message]"
  }],
  isError: true
}
```

## üíª Development

To run the server locally for development:

1. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file
2. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```
3. Start the server:

## üåü Future Possibilities

The Salesforce API is incredibly rich and offers numerous possibilities for expansion. Here are some areas where this MCP server could grow:

- Integration with Salesforce Flow and Process Builder
- Custom object support
- Bulk API operations for large datasets
- Chatter API integration
- Analytics API support
- Custom report and dashboard access

We'd love to hear your ideas about what would be most valuable to add next!
